 2. Build & Deploy the model;
 3. Visit the application and use the "Configuration" tile and fill the configuration form with your company info;
 4. Add your coworkers (or a shared internal email) to the role "Consult";
 5. That's it, all your coworkers now have access to your company's COVID-19 documents and communications.


## Application Features

- Automatically generate COVID-19 guideline documents and general workforce recomendations. These documents are template-based, allowing companies to easily edit them, if needed.
- Upload internal company documents such as Contingency Plan, new time tables, etc, and make them imediatelly available to the workforce;
- Upload COVID-19 related internal bulletins (separate from other documents)
- Check the current status of the pandemic on a dedicated "Status" dashboard embeded with the recommended WHO COVID-19 tracker (see dashboard source)  


## Let's evercome this together

We urge everyone interested in this application to join us and contribute to improve this application as needs start to appear. Together we can improve faster, better and without wasted time (there's no need for two companies to develop two solutions to the same problem). 

We'll be improving upon this application soon and updating it right here for all to use it as well.

Thank you and stay safe, this too shall pass.
